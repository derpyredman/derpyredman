Hey, have I ever told you how much I love you? How much you mean to me, how much I care about you, how much I think about you all the time. You're the love of my life, Nikita. I love to say that name, Nikita. I still remember the first time you told me. You were so shy. You were also very shy to tell me your second name. Maybe you thought I'd try to look up your parents on social media, but you didn't know that my brain wasn't that developed. You're the light to my darkness, the voice in the silence, the only shining star in a night sky. You're my world, my everything. You're the one that made me realize what love was, what truly meant doing stupid things for someone else. You made me learn the good aspects of life, boo. You made me the person I am today. You made me mature, you made me grow. Your love made me grow, and because of that, every day my love grows for you. I really love you, Nikita. I love you so much. Those words come from the deepest parts of my heart. I love you. Your beauty always blinds me. The way you laugh, the way you smile, the way you eat, the way you look at me, the way you talk, they always put butterflies in my stomach. I say this with all my heart, Nikita, I love you. I love you, I love you! I love you!! I love you, Nikita. You've shown me happiness, you've shown me sadness, you've shown me what life really was, what it meant to love someone, what it meant to sacrifice, what it meant to live. I've loved you so much, Nikita. No matter what happens, I cannot remove the emotions I feel for you. You've truly struck me, Nikita. You've made me yours. I am yours. Forever yours. I love you, Nikita. I love you. No matter what happens I'll always love you, and promise to stay by you're side till my death. 

      yours truly
